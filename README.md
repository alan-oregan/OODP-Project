#### Application Overview:
This is a point of sale computer program for a coffee shop.
The program displays the menu from an inventory file,allows the user to process orders and then save them to a transaction file.

## Functional Requirements
---
- [x] Display Menu from Inventory File
- [x] Add Items to Order
- [x] Remove Items from Order
- [x] Display Order
- [x] Display Total
- [x] Take Payment
- [x] Display Receipt
- [x] Save Order to Transaction File


## User Requirements and Interface

## Design Patterns
---
The design patterns I chose to implement in this project are as follows:

### Behavioural

#### Command
For the  Behavioural pattern I implemented the command pattern as it allows the user to undo and redo actions. 
This is useful for a point of sale system as it allows the user to undo an order if they make a mistake or change their mind. 
It also allows the user to redo an order if they accidentally undo an order.

### Structural

#### Decorator
For the structural pattern I implemented the decorator pattern as it makes it easier to modify the transaction log depending on the transaction type.

### Creational

#### Singletons
For the creational pattern I implemented the singleton pattern as it allows for only one instance of FileHandler to be created.
Because it is synchronised it is thread safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment.

As I was implementing the singleton pattern I thought why not make it a static class, and so I looked into the idea and found this: 

> A Singletons can implement interfaces, inherit from other classes and allow inheritance. While a static class cannot inherit their instance members. So Singletons is more flexible than static classes and can maintain state.

#### Builder
I also implemented the builder pattern as it allows for the creation of a transaction object with different attributes depending on the transaction type.
