##Program Description

*Cafe Point of Sale System*
Created by: *Alan O'Regan*
Student Number: *B00133474*

This is a point of sale computer program for a Coffee shop.
The Program displays the menu from an inventory file, allows the user to process orders and save them to a transaction file.

***

##The System Menu

The **menu items** are read from an **inventory csv file** in the format: ***[item name], [price]***
Each menu item name and price is added to an ArrayList of MenuItem Objects.

####Item Number options
The user is **allowed** to enter as **many items** as they want from the list of menu items.

####The Remove Option
The user **can delete** items from their order by selecting the this option and entering the **item order number** from the current order displayed.

####The Payment Option
The user **complete the transaction** by selecting this option and entering the required information.

The program will then *process* the customers transaction using the following *steps*:

1. The total price is calculated from ordered item prices within **MenuItem ArrayList**.
2. The user selects *CASH or CARD* transaction.
   - If **cash transaction** then the **amount tendered** will be entered and **change** calculated from the price difference if any.
   - If **card transaction** then the **card type** (Visa/Master) will be selected.

3. The program gets the transaction **timestamp** in the format *(dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss)* and saves the transaction in an **ArrayList of TransactionItems**.

An appropriate **receipt** will then be generated on screen.

####The Exit Option

When the coffee shop owner exits the system, all the days transactions are written to a **transaction.csv** file from the **ArrayList of TransactionItems**.

***

##Transaction Formats:

####Cash Transaction format
*[Date and time stamp], [Item/s Purchased], [Price], [Amount tendered], [Change given]*

####Card Transaction format
*[Date and time stamp], [Item/s Purchased], [Price], [Card Type]*
